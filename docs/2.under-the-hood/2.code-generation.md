Composables are automatically generated by WPNuxt based on [predefined queries](https://github.com/vernaillen/wpnuxt-module/tree/main/src/runtime/queries) as well as your own [custom queries](../advanced/custom-post-types.md).

This is done with the help of [GraphQL-Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen)

# Composables

Composables are generated based on the given queries.

## prefix

Default prefix: useWP

Can be changed in config:

```ts
wpNuxt: {
    ...
    generateComposables: {
      enabled: true,
      prefix: 'use'
    }
},
```

# Types
