### Configure Image Provider

Since images are uploaded in WordPress, we can configure Nuxt Image to use an image provider that fetches the images from WordPress and optimises them.

TODO: add configuration example

### wp-contennt proxy

You can configure a proxy routeRule in Nuxt:

```ts
routeRules: {
  '/wp-content/**': { proxy: { to: 'https://yourwordpress.com/wp-content/**' } }
},
```
