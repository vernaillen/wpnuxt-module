Types are exported by the [Nuxt GraphQL Middleware plugin](https://nuxt-graphql-middleware.dulnan.net/) and can be imported with the [#graphql-operations](https://nuxt-graphql-middleware.dulnan.net/features/typescript.html#importing-types) alias.

for example:
```ts
import type { PostFragment, PageFragment } from '#graphql-operations'
```
