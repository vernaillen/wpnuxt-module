## New Project

### Configure Wordpress

install these 3 plugins in WordPress:
 * [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)
 * WPEngine's [Faust.js](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/)
 * WPEngine's [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) (you'll need to download the latest release as a zip file from the [release page on github](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/releases) and install manually in wordpress)

#### WordPress settings
Set the WordPress permalinks to postname (so the slug can be used as a dynamic route in Nuxt)

#### WPGraphQL settings
* enable introspection

#### Faust plugin:
* set the front-end site url
* copy the secret key
* depending on how you're going to handle image url's in Nuxt, you might have to enable "Use the WordPress domain for media URLs in post content"


### Add WPNuxt to your Nuxt app

```
pnpm add -D @vernaillen/wpnuxt
```

nuxt-config.ts
```
modules: ['@vernaillen/wpnuxt']
```

### Configure WPNuxt

Connect WPNuxt to your wordpress installation:

```
    wpNuxt: {
        wordpressUrl: 'https://wordpress.wpnuxt.com',
        frontendUrl: 'https://demo.wpnuxt.com',
        faustSecretKey: '',
        showBlockInfo: false,
        debug: false,
        replaceSchema: false,
        enableCache: true
    },
```
Include the protocol.
You can set showBlockInfo to true, if you want to see the json payload of the rendered Gutenberg blocks.

the frontendUrl should be the url of the Nuxt app and is used to redirect the user to after authenticating in wordpress.

When you start Nuxt after adding the WPNuxt module, it might ask whether you want to install the @nuxt/image package:
````
❯ Do you want to install @nuxt/image package?
● Yes / ○ No
```


### Configure Image Provider

Since images are uploaded in WordPress, we can configure Nuxt Image to use an image provider that fetches the images from WordPress and optimises them.
